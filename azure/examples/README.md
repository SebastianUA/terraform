Event Grid is deeply integrated with Azure services and can be integrated with third-party services. It simplifies event consumption and lowers costs by eliminating the need for constant polling. Event Grid efficiently and reliably routes events from Azure and non-Azure resources. It distributes the events to registered subscriber endpoints. The event message has the information you need to react to changes in services and applications. Event Grid isn't a data pipeline, and doesn't deliver the actual object that was updated. The official documentation is here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services.

- [LB](https://github.com/SebastianUA/terraform/tree/master/azure/examples/lb) - Load balancing refers to evenly distributing load (incoming network traffic) across a group of backend resources or servers. Azure Load Balancer operates at layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It's the single point of contact for clients. Load balancer distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's front end to backend pool instances. These flows are according to configured load-balancing rules and health probes. The backend pool instances can be Azure Virtual Machines or instances in a virtual machine scale set. The official documentation is here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.

You may write a simple query that returns a set of records and then use features of Log Analytics to sort, filter, and analyze them. Or you may write a more advanced query to perform statistical analysis and visualize the results in a chart to identify a particular trend. Whether you work with the results of your queries interactively or use them with other Azure Monitor features such as log query alerts or workbooks, Log Analytics is the tool that you're going to use write and test them. The official documentation is here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.

- [Logic app](https://github.com/SebastianUA/terraform/tree/master/azure/examples/logic_app) - Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based platform for creating and running automated workflows that integrate your apps, data, services, and systems.

- [Managed application](https://github.com/SebastianUA/terraform/tree/master/azure/examples/managed_application) - Azure managed applications enable you to offer cloud solutions that are easy for consumers to deploy and operate. You implement the infrastructure and provide ongoing support. To make a managed application available to all customers, publish it in the Azure marketplace. To make it available to only users in your organization, publish it to an internal catalog. A managed application is similar to a solution template in the Marketplace, with one key difference. In a managed application, the resources are deployed to a resource group that's managed by the publisher of the app. The resource group is present in the consumer's subscription, but an identity in the publisher's tenant has access to the resource group. As the publisher, you specify the cost for ongoing support of the solution. The official documentation is here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/managed-applications/overview.

- [Management](https://github.com/SebastianUA/terraform/tree/master/azure/examples/management) - Management refers to the tasks and processes required to maintain your business applications and the resources that support them.
